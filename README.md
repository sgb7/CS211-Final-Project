# CS211-Final-Project

For my project, I'll make a game of virutal checkers, with an AI that plays against you.

Notes:
  Not complete, but the red checkers can be moved--not the white checkers, but that's on purpose, since they were supposed to be moved by the game AI--and when a the red checkers and white checkers collide, the white checker vanishes from the screen.
