Final

	(Not sure if we’re supposed to do this for the final project, but I figure better safe than sorry.)
	I’ll start by saying I wasn’t able to finish this in time, though not for lack of trying. (That seems to be my trend, lately; maybe I need to work on my time management skills.) I think the main reason why was because of how I went about setting up my checkerboard. I didn’t use any kind of grid system, and then when I went back to try and change that I got stuck on how exactly to go about it. Eventually, I was forced to move on, as I had other stuff to get done. 
	Here’s what I did manage to accomplish though. I got the checker pieces to instantiate in their correct pattern/places, and made it so the red checkers—the player’s checkers—could be moved by the player, while the white checkers—the enemy’s checkers—could not be moved. I also made it so when a red checker and white checker collided while a red checker was being moved, the white checker would delete itself, to mimic an opponents piece being taken. (I couldn’t get it working the other way around though, weirdly enough. I still haven’t figured out why.) 
	I wanted to make it so potential moves that could be made with a checker piece were highlighted when you clicked on a piece, but wasn’t able to finish it. So what basically happens right now is that, when you click on checker piece, the area around it is highlighted, and that highlight vanishes once the checker is moved. Not really what I wanted, but again, I ran out of time.
	So yeah. Despite not finishing, this was a cool project. It was interesting to consider the inner workings of the game and how I might implement them. If I could do anything different, I would definitely try to instantiate my game objects on a grid right off, instead of doing it the way I did it.
